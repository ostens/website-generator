# Erin Austin
<img src="/images/erin.jpeg" align="right" width="300" style="padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:20px;"> Following a BSc in Physics at the University of St Andrews, I am now working at Imray, Laurie, Norie & Wilson as a GIS Analyst. This involves working with FME/S57/MAPublisher systems, project management of app development and geoprocessing work. 

I'm interested in geospatial problem solving using R and Python, as well as open source packages (OSGeo4W). I'm also interested in learning to code more generally. Check out my [blog](/) where I will be posting some of my solutions to geospatial problems as well as general command line shortcuts. More than anything else, this blog is for me to keep track of what I've learnt and the solutions I've written.

Feel free to visit my [github](//github.com/ostens) or contact me via [email](mailto:erinjayaustin@gmail.com).
