# Erin Austin

Following a BSc (hons) in Physics from the University of St Andrews, I am now working at Imray, Laurie, Norie & WIlson as a GIS Analyst. I'm interested in geospatial problem solving using R and Python, as well as open source packages (OSGeo4W). Check out my blog where I will be posting some of my solutions to geospatial problems as well as general command line shortcuts.
