<p align="left"><img src="/images/erin.jpeg" align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:20px;"> Following a BSc (hons) in Physics from the University of St Andrews, I started working at Imray, Laurie, Norie & WIlson as a digital product coordinator, which involved everything from product ownership of iOS and Android apps, to geospatial data processing, to product support. </p> I wanted to explore more technical pursuits and moved to the North East where I started working as a Software Test Engineer, before moving to a new company specialising in accounting software and moving back to a product owner role. Determined this time to get back to what I love the most, I'm embarking on a software development bootcamp at Northcoders. I'm hoping to continue to add sporadic posts here about what I learn!
