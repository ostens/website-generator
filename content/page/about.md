<img src="/images/erin.jpeg" align="right" width="300" style="padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:20px;"> Following graduating with a BSc in Physics from the University of St Andrews in 2016 and a few years working with geospatial data and navigation apps as a product owner, I am now moving into the world of software development as a Graduate Test Engineer for [Scott Logic](//https://www.scottlogic.com/) in Newcastle.

This is my personal blog where I post sporadically about solutions to problems I've found particularly challenging. Feel free to visit my [github](//github.com/ostens) or contact me via [email](mailto:erinjayaustin@gmail.com).
