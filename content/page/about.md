# Erin Austin
<img src="/images/erin.jpeg" align="right" width="300" style="padding-left:20px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:20px;"> Following a BSc in Physics at the University of St Andrews, I am now working at Imray, Laurie, Norie & Wilson as a GIS Analyst. I'm interested in geospatial problem solving using R and Python, as well as open source packages (OSGeo4W). Check out my [blog](/) where I will be posting some of my solutions to geospatial problems as well as general command line shortcuts.

Feel free to visit my [github](//github.com/ostens) or contact me via [email](mailto:erinjayaustin@gmail.com).
